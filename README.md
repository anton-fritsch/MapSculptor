MapSculptor
===========

Tools for procedurally generated maps.

MapSculptor aims to provide a simple library and helper scripts to aid the development of
procedurally generated maps using commonly accepted methods. Currently included in this
package is:

* 2D Cellular Automata
* Perlin Noise
* Fractional Brownian Motion

Demos
-----

Visualizations are included in the `demos/` directory to demonstrate very basic implementations. Instructions
on how to run and view them may be found in the [readme](https://github.com/anton-fritsch/MapSculptor/blob/package/demos/README.md). More sophisticated application of the library may provide significantly better (or at least varying) results. YMMV.

Installation
------------

Assuming the directory MapSculptor exists in the current directory, execute:
`pip install -e MapSculptor`

Requirements
------------

Numpy
